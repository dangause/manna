"""Tool for querying the curated per-table schema knowledge base.

`vo_schema_describe(archive, table)` returns table-specific structured
facts (missing ObsCore columns, enum values, spatial index columns) that
the agent can use before composing an ADQL query. Archive-level quirks
(ADQL bugs, mode requirements) are in vo_archive_list instead.

It also returns the table's **real column list**, fetched live from the
archive's `tap_schema.columns`. That used to be missing, which made this tool
actively harmful: the curated notes told the model "always project an explicit
column list" while supplying neither the columns nor a route to them, so a model
that obeyed had to invent column names. The pointer to `vo_registry_describe`
existed only on the miss path, so the better-curated a table was, the blinder the
model got.

If the fetch fails the payload carries `column_list_recipe` instead — the exact
query to run. Whenever the archive's TAP endpoint is known, exactly one of
`columns` / `column_list_recipe` is present. For an archive we have no endpoint
for there is nothing to ask and no recipe worth offering, so the miss envelope
stays bare.

Soft-fails on miss (returns `known: false`) — that means only "no curated notes",
not "no such table"; the column list is still returned for a known archive.
