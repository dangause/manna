"""Archive model — the dataclasses one archive's knowledge is built from.

An **archive** is the portable, plugin-style unit of curated knowledge: its
identity + endpoints + usage_notes, together with the per-table `Schema`
entries for that same archive. One archive = one file under `archives/`.

`Archive` and `Schema` live here so the model is a dependency-free leaf; the
endpoint/schema helpers in `archives/_endpoints.py` and `archives/_knowledge.py`
import them from here. `Note` (one atomic curated claim) and its `Audit` (how
the live runner re-checks it) also
live here — every `usage_notes` / `Schema.notes` entry is a `Note`, no other
form accepted.

class Trap:
    """How a note's claim gets DELIVERED to the model, and when.

    A note in `vo_archive_list` is knowledge the model *can* reach. A trap is
    knowledge we push at it, because the eval showed reachable isn't enough
    (issue #57: the NRAO LOWER/UPPER note was true, probed, and served — and
    the model still wrote LOWER()). Like `Audit`, this is declarative: it
    carries no delivery code. `archives/_traps.py` reads these.

    Two kinds, split by whether the model can self-correct from the failure,
    and told apart entirely by ``triggers``:

    - **silent** (no ``triggers``) — the model gets NO usable correction
      signal, so the claim must arrive BEFORE the query. Either the query
      silently returns a wrong answer (ALMA: COUNT(*) over-counts, no error)
      or it errors so cryptically that the message doesn't imply the fix
      (Data Lab: ADQL geometry surfaces as `function point(...) does not
      exist`, which never suggests q3c). These go in the `vo_tap_query`
      description — the expensive channel, re-sent every turn, so the bar is
      high and `guidance` must be terse.
    - **loud** (``triggers`` set) — the query throws, and the triggers
      recognise the cause in the submitted ADQL. `guidance` rides the error
      payload's `hint` instead, so it costs nothing until it fires.

    `guidance` is the compact, imperative fix — not the note's full prose.
